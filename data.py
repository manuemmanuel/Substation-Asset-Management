responses = {
    "standard_tests_transformer": "During routine transformer maintenance, standard tests include turns ratio test, insulation resistance test, and oil dielectric strength test. These tests ensure the transformer's integrity and performance.",
    "acceptable_limits_reactor": "The acceptable limit for the insulation resistance test of a reactor is typically 1 megohm or higher. Readings below this value indicate potential insulation issues.",
    "safety_guidelines_circuit_breaker": "During circuit breaker maintenance, ensure proper lockout/tagout procedures, wear appropriate PPE, and de-energize the circuit. Following NFPA 70E guidelines for electrical safety is crucial.",
    "issue_resolution_surge_arrester": "If a surge arrester fails the routine inspection test, it should be immediately replaced. A failed surge arrester compromises the substation's protection against overvoltages.",
    "resolve_abnormal_noise_transformer": "Abnormal noise from a transformer can indicate issues like loose laminations. Steps include visual inspection, tightening bolts, and consulting a technician if the issue persists.",
    "frequency_dissolved_gas_analysis": "The industry standard for dissolved gas analysis in transformer oil is typically conducted annually. It helps identify potential faults within the transformer.",
    "safety_precautions_SF6_gas": "When handling SF6 gas during circuit breaker maintenance, wear protective gloves and goggles. Work in well-ventilated areas, and follow the manufacturer's guidelines for handling and disposal.",
    "common_tests_instrument_transformers": "Common tests on instrument transformers include ratio tests and polarity tests. These tests ensure accuracy in measurement, which is crucial for proper functioning of protective relays and meters in the substation.",
    "troubleshoot_circuit_breaker_trips": "Troubleshooting a circuit breaker involves checking for loose connections, worn contacts, or excessive load. Inspecting these factors and consulting the manufacturer's manual can help identify and resolve the issue.",
    "maintenance_frequency_lightning_arresters": "Lightning arresters should be inspected annually. Regular maintenance ensures they can effectively divert lightning-induced surges away from sensitive equipment, preventing damage."
